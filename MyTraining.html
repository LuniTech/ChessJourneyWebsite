<h1>Biography</h1>
<h2>Early Years</h2>
 My name is Innocent. I mainly play blitz chess occasionally. Started playing at around the age of 9 when my mother bought me a chess/checkers set. Of course I had to figure out the rules on my own by reading the instructions that came with the set and then later on by reading books from the Msunduzi library. <br>

My first "legal" game in which the rules of the game were obeyed correctly was against a cellphone program I downloaded on my mother's cellphone back in 2006-2007. 

<h2>Teenage years</h2>

My interest was really piqued after watching a Bobby Fischer documentary on YouTube called <a href="https://youtu.be/lwLM9bgE3tY?feature=shared">"Anything to Win"</a>towards the end of my high school years. Being beaten with great ease by students from St. Charles College also served to motivate me to grow and improve. <br><br>Admittedly, my growth in the 2020's has not been as substantive. I have lost a little bit of ambition. In a sense, I am waiting for it to "miraculously" come back so I can progress further and aim for an official chess title OTB.

<h2>Adult Years</h2>

I've played many masters and international masters here. I lose most of the time, but I am satisfied with the occasional wins that I amass against titled players.
<br><br>
 My proudest result is against the legendary Grandmaster Rogelio Antonio Jr., AKA GM Joey. I managed a 2-2 result against him in a 4-game mini-match:

 

I have many other interests too. I like reading, following football occasionally (Chelsea and Barcelona supporter), learning, drawing, geology, popular science material, philosophy, psychology,futurism, AI, etc. I love animals a lot. A real lot.

Overall, I have some eccentric characteristics that may take some getting used to. Once you get used to me, you may find that I'm quite harmless and can be generous laid back sometimes.
