<h1>Biography</h1>
<h2>Early Years</h2>
 My name is Innocent. I primarily specialize in blitz chess online. My chess journey had its beginning when I was 9 years old when my mother bought a chess/checkers set for me and my brother. However the rules seemed somewhat abstract. There were few pictures available to eloborate on what the lexical descriptions were trying to convey. 
What was a daigonal I remembered asking. I proceeded to get a dictionary to look up the definition. However I could not quite understand. Was it refering to the diagonal with each individual square or another diagon.

I then began attending the local Msunduzi library where I happened upon a book that explain the rules of the game using both words and pictorial illustration. I could not burrow the book from the library at that point since I did not yet have a library card. So I tried to remember the rules. 

I then excitedly bought a chess set to challenge my brother. I tried to explain the rules as well as I could remember them. However they were not correct. There were times where I tried to make up new rules and my brother called me out on this.

There came a period of time when I forgot about the game. However my mother had a nokia phone which had several games. These games included "snake", "space impact", "bounce" and chess puzzles. Seeing the chess puzzles game rekindled my interest in chess. 

I returned to the library again to learn the rules. However, even though I learned the rules, I could not solve the puzzles on my mothers cellphone. 

A time came when my mother bought a new cellphone and I became aquinted with how to download games from the internet. I remember downloading a chess playing application and challenged my brother! This time, the rules would have to be followed! The game also made learning the rules easier as it highlighted the legal moves that were possible when I clicked on a piece! 

And hence, my brother and I played. And I lost every single time! But at least I finally understood the rules and all that I had read previously began to click and make sense.

Incidently, around this period, when I had learned chess, I would have an opponent that was not my brother. It was a young girl from my class name Nadia Mohammed. She had surprisingly brought a chess set to school. No one seemed to know how to play except me. I then played her and as I was winning she got frustrated and broke the rules. She picked up her knight and moved it far down the board in an L-shape to capture my king and then announced that she had won!
This led to a bitter argument and we never played again.

I discovered later on that my mathematics teacher, Mr. Ebenezer could play chess. I was one of the top math pupils in the grade and had a great deal of respect for Mr. Ebenezer. He quite skilled in arithmetic and seemed to make no mistakes. I viewed him as supremely intelligent - there was no way a young mortal like myself could approach his great intellect. 

Nevertheless we played a game and I won! I could not believe that I was a superior to chess player! It baffled me. 

Shortly after our encounter, the school announced a series of games, raging from tenis, football, chess and checkers. I decided to play both chess and football! My football team called "the peace makers" got knocked out of the tournament. However I still had chess to look forward to.

In the final round, I face a young girl named robyn lee. She was attractive and she earlier shoved me aside as we accidently bumped into each other. I had a great deal of anxiety playing her, but the brief physical encounter motivated me to "settle the score."

I won that encounter and I was crowned chess champion of mountain rise primary school. It was the seventh grade. My final year! The next year, I would be attending Alexandra high school.

High school began on a Wednesday and I had a great deal of self-confindence and enthusiasm. My brother had already told me about all the exciting sports and extra-cirricular activities offered by the school. However, I had little interest in chess. I wanted to be a popular boy. Hence I chose a novel and active sport i.e. basketball.

I was afraid of being identified as a nerd. In primary school I was very physically active. At one point I was 4th position in the whole grade for a marathon. When I was 10, I was the fastest boy in my age group. I did not want to be viewed as an intellectual but as a Jock who could relate to most people.

During orientation, different sports were introduced. The chess captain took the podium to introduce chess and what he said intimidated me. He said that chess is for serious people. I was never that serious even though I tended to perform well academically. I was afraid of exerting myself mentally too much. On that day I decided not to play chess as an extramural.

There came a day in which a friend of mine, named Hlakanipho came from the library after doing our homework. As we passed the halls we noticed a classroom in which chess was being played. Hlakanipho suggested that we play if I knew how. I agreed.

I won that game against him and then I was pitched against one of the strongest boys in the school. I also won that game and everyone was very shocked. I was invited for chess practice in one afternoon that very week.

I was winning most of my games quite easily. I would open with the scholars mate setup. Some of my weaker opponents fell for it. The more experienced players countered it and the game would continue normally.

I was close to selection when my brother showed up. We were paired against each other and he always had a psychological advantage as he was always bigger and stronger than me. I lost most of my games against. He was my one true nemesis!

My brother knocked me out. I was not selected to play for the team. However he declined the spot! I guess he just wanted to humble me. That was his only objective. He couldn't care less about serious playing which is rather unfortunate as he was naturally and highly talented.

There came a point in the 8th grade where one team player quit. The captain selected me to take his spot. I played many students from several different schools, including Maritzburg college, Weikhem collegiate, St Charles, Ixopho secondary, Maritzburg christian school, Hilton College among others.

My final standing was 3rd place overall! I received my first chess trophy and certificate!

Of course I had to figure out the rules on my own by reading the instructions that came with the set and then later on by reading books from the Msunduzi library. <br>

My first "legal" game in which the rules of the game were obeyed correctly was against a cellphone program I downloaded on my mother's cellphone back in 2006-2007. 

<h2>Teenage years</h2>

My interest was really piqued after watching a Bobby Fischer documentary on YouTube called <a href="https://youtu.be/lwLM9bgE3tY?feature=shared">"Anything to Win"</a>towards the end of my high school years. Being beaten with great ease by students from St. Charles College also served to motivate me to grow and improve. <br><br>Admittedly, my growth in the 2020's has not been as substantive. I have lost a little bit of ambition. In a sense, I am waiting for it to "miraculously" come back so I can progress further and aim for an official chess title OTB.

<h2>Adult Years</h2>

I've played many masters and international masters here. I lose most of the time, but I am satisfied with the occasional wins that I amass against titled players.
<br><br>
 My proudest result is against the legendary Grandmaster Rogelio Antonio Jr., AKA GM Joey. I managed a 2-2 result against him in a 4-game mini-match:

 

I have many other interests too. I like reading, following football occasionally (Chelsea and Barcelona supporter), learning, drawing, geology, popular science material, philosophy, psychology,futurism, AI, etc. I love animals a lot. A real lot.

Overall, I have some eccentric characteristics that may take some getting used to. Once you get used to me, you may find that I'm quite harmless and can be generous laid back sometimes.
